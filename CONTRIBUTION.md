cd AU_ETH_Bootcamp
```

**4.** Set upstream command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SiddheshKukade/AU_ETH_Bootcamp
```

**5.** Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**6.** Sync your fork or your local repository with the origin repository:

-   In your forked repository, click on "Fetch upstream"

**7.** Make your changes to the source code.

**8.** Stage your changes:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure** not to commit `package.json` or `package-lock.json` file

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure** not to run the commands `git add .` or `git add *`

> Instead, stage your changes for each file/folder
>
> By using public path it means it will add all files and folders under that folder, it is better to be specific

```bash
git add public
```

_or_

```bash
git add "<files_you_have_changed>"
```

**9.** Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
